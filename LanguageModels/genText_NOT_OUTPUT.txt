goodbye.





XIII.

REFUGE.

It was not so much as I hoped
For such a long shore to call my heart,
But just beyond the sea
A minor coasting be.

To stay just a little longer
Would have been well, to see
What harm I had done.
But as it was, I must turn
And go to sea for ever.





XIV.

THE WIND.

Of all the sounds despatched abroad,
None is like the wind.
His schooner is shaped like a heart,
And rowed in a sea of blue.
His hock and marge and spade
Hold fast the secrets of stay.

And he shakes his big blue flag
For me in the new tongue
He learns of summer.





XV.

A little boat o'erspent with gales
Retrimmed itself in seaward weeds,
And was as much treasure
In the sea as were three
Degrees parted.

Far from home the little boat
Seemed to finds its anchorage,
And shudders are off shore.





XVI.

Whether my bark went down at sea,
Whether she met with gales,
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails.

By what mystic mooring
She is held to-day, --
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the bay.





XVII.

SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.

The gentian weaves her fringes,
The maple's loom is red.
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness,
An hour to prepare;
And one, below this morning,
Is where the angels are.

It was a short procession, --
The bobolink was there,
An aged bee addressed us,
And then we knelt in prayer.

We trust that she was willing, --
We ask that we may be.
Summer, sister, seraph,
Let us go with thee!

In the name of the bee
And of the butterfly
And of the breeze, amen!





XVIII.

FRINGED GENTIAN.

God made a little gentian;
It tried to be a rose
And failed, and all the summer laughed.
But just before
