goodbye
  To the music;
Was it the last time?
  I'll forget the first,
But the time will loop,
  And I will forget the date.





V.

I've got a doubt -- does God forbid
  A doubt arises here?

If He forbid anything,
  It is like a prohibition
To put a bubble
  Upon a globe,

And gauge the fame
  By whose permission this be.
====================
goodbye,
     And hang, like witches, from a gallows;
But this time, adequate, erect,
     With will to live.





LIX.

RESURGAM.

At last to be identified!
At last, the lamps upon thy side,
    The rest of life to see!

At every step expect the other,
    The same caution to take,
As
====================
goodbye.

'T is a large world,
And I but a child;
How vast am I to miss
  So small my homemade face
Is now visible!





V.

To hang our head ostensibly,
  And subsequent to find
That such was not the posture
Of our immortal mind,
  Correcting a posterior;

This is the imperial habitation
  Of our provisional abode.





VI.


====================
goodbye"
  And then what?

And if I do, when time's brief masquerade
  Is done,
Wherefore, mine eyelids?
  I'll wait till you ask me,
And then tell you the rest.
